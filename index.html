    <p><em>Clinical Informatics Fellow, <a href="https://pennmedicine.org">Penn Medicine</a><br>
        Medical Student, <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a></em></p>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>After growing up outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota, I attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I majored in psychology and developed an affinity for public service. While in medical school, Iâ€™ve coupled this affinity with my
      interest in healthcare innovation to work on projects that improve the way the electronic health record helps clinicians care for under-resourced patients. Though I am still primarily a medical student at Penn, I am taking a year out of
      my studies to
      learn about the clinical informatics realm by working within the <a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/clinical-informatics">Office of the CMIO</a> at Penn Medicine. In this role, I also conduct research through the
      <a href="https://www.nudgeunit.upenn.edu">Penn Medicine Nudge Unit</a>, the world's first behavioral design team embedded within a health system.
    </p>
    <p>Prior to entering medical school, I intended to train as a professional cellist and still play with the <a href="https://pennmedsymphony.com">Penn Med Symphony Orchestra</a> as well as my string quartet with my spare time. I additionally
      enjoy digital photography and have received multiple blue ribbons at the Minnesota State Fair for my work. Otherwise, I enjoy freelance writing, long-distance running, reading, and hot yoga.</p>
